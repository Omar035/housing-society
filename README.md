# housing-society
This project was originally created for my level-1 term-2 lab work as a revision of the C programming language. 

Let's dive deeper into the functionality of this program. This program has three major parts that you can focus to understand the workflow.
1. The definitions of structures and unions
2. The driver function (main function)
3. Function definitions

1. Structures and Unions:
The Housing Society is considered as an array of 'Spaces'. Each Space can be a building or a park. A building can be of a certain type which an user must choose. A building can be an apartment, a school, a hospital.
